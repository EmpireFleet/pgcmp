  A simple test...

  Load database #1 with ~schema1.sql~, then database #2 with
  ~schema1.sql~ /and/ ~schema2.sql~, which alters things by adding,
  removing, and modifying objects.

  Then run ~pgcmp~ against them.  The differences should be rather
  suggestable by virtue of the modifications made in ~schema2.sql~.

  The script ~run-tests.sh~ does this, using databases:
  - test1 :: contains ~schema1~
  - test2 :: contains ~schema1+2~
  - comparisondatabase :: used to contain the comparison
